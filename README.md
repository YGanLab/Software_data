        An accurate and automated tissue segmentation algorithm for retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images is crucial for the diagnosis of glaucoma. A novel graph convolutional network (GCN)-assisted two-stage framework is proposed to simultaneously label the nine retinal layers and the optic disc. Specifically, a multi-scale global reasoning module is inserted between the encoder and decoder of a U-shape neural network to exploit anatomical prior knowledge and perform spatial reasoning.

- Inpainting for saturation artifacts in optical coherence tomog-raphy using dictionary-based sparse representation. *IEEE Photonics Journal, vol. 13, no. 2, pp. 1–10.* [[code]](https://github.com/YGanLab/OCT-Inpainting)

        In this paper, we propose a novel method to localize and correct saturation artifacts in SD-OCT images. Specifically, we formulate the artifact removal problem as an image inpainting problem and adopt sparse representation framework to solve it.

- On the spectral leakageand speckle formation in fourier-domain optical coherence tomography, *Optics Letter, 2020.* [[code]](https://github.com/MengyuanWang524/Super-resolution-OCT)

        We report on the investigation of spectral leakage’s impact on the reconstruction of Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT). We discuss the shift-variant nature introduced by the spectral leakage and develop a novel spatial-domain FD-OCT image formation model. 

- Analyzing three-dimensional ultrastructure of human cervical tissue using optical coherence tomography, *Biomedical Optics Express, vol. 6, no. 4, pp. 1090–1108, Oct. 2015.* [[code]](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-dtb4-6j91)

        We used optical coherence tomography to investigate the directionality and dispersion of collagen fiber bundles in the human cervix. An image analysis tool has been developed, combining a stitching method with a fiber orientation measurement, to study axially sliced cervix samples. This tool was used to analyze the ultrastructure of ex-vivo pregnant and non-pregnant hysterectomy tissue samples taken at the internal os, which is the region of the cervix adjacent to the uterus.
